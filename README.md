# Sorting-Visualizer
a sorting visualizer serves as an interactive and engaging way to learn, explore, and compare various sorting algorithms. It bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge (how the algorithm works) and practical understanding (how the steps unfold on a visual level).

A web application showcasing the inner workings of sorting algorithms.

Implemented algorithms:
1) Bubble sort
2) Selection sort
3) Insertion sort
4) Merge sort
5) Quick sort
6) Heap sort

Features:
1) Colored representation of step being executed.
  1.1) Blue:default
  1.2) Yellow: Being compared
  1.3) Red: Identified as in incorrect position and to be moved
  1.4) Green: In correct position
2) 3 Controls for visualizations
  2.1) Speed of visualization (5 speed levels)
  2.2) Data size ()
  2.3) Generation of new data (Randomly generate new data).
4) Time and Space complexity of algorithm being visualized.
